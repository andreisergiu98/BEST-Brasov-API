# BEST Brasov API

## Description
None, yet.

## Development setup
First things first make sure you have the following programs installed:
- nodejs
- yarn
- docker
- docker-compose

I highly recommend using an IDE: vscode, intellij, webstorm + tslint integration.

To start your development environment run the following commands:

```yarn
# install dependencies
$ yarn

# start the docker containers
$ yarn start
```
